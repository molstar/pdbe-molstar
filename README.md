  - Use a version number like "1.2.3-beta.1" for development versions (to be used in development environment wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk)
  - Use a version number like "1.2.3" for proper releases
- Ensure install, lint, and rebuild works locally
- Git commit and push
- Create a git tag matching the version with prepended "v" (e.g. "v1.2.3")
- The GitHub repo will automatically be mirrored to EBI GitLab (might take up to 1 hour)
- CICD pipeline in EBI GitLab will automatically publish the package to npm (https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdbe-molstar)
